A library 
	is a collection of functions / objects that serves one particular purpose.
	 you could use a library in a variety of projects. 
	(Various specialized services in our case)

	ex: JQuery library, is a library of prewritten,
	 cross-browser Javascript animations and functions 
	which you will need while making a website.


An API 
	is an interface for other programs to interact with your program or library 
	 without having direct access.
	 ( giving specifications for our need to various vendors in our case)

	ex: with Google Map APIs you can show maps for different places without 
	writing/hosting the whole code on your server, and just use it,
	 usually this data transfer is in form of JSON i.e JavaScript Object Notation.
